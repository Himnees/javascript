// The var keyword is almost the same as let. It also declares a variable, but in a slightly different, “old-school” way.

// There are subtle differences between let and var, but they do not matter for us yet. We’ll cover them in detail in the chapter The old "var".

// var can be reclared

var message = 'world'
